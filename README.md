# hello-world
first GitHub repository test guide, hello-world
i'm new to git hub

everybody knows how to use it

it have to learn it too

i really like it so far

this is just random thoughts

just wanted to write some lines 

in no particular order

I'm watching Punjab 1984 right now

really good movie if you can find subtitles for it

right now the guy just got home and is saying:
"I'm hungry mom"

proceeds to die.
